# JavaAssembler
This was an assignment for [Miracosta College - CS Department](https://github.com/miracosta-college) for the requisite Computer Architecture class. 
This is a Java programming project wherein I needed to create an assembler to turn assembly language into machine code for the computer.
This would then be used by a compiler to compile a high level programming language like Java down to assembly language and then by the assembler down to machine code.
